For the first exchangemeet, we met with Siwei Mai. 

A little background on how it happened: Siwei and I were both TA for the Digital System Design. I got to know that he reserach was in brain computer interface and showed me one of his resaerch poster. During my undergrad (in 2014), I was planning to build some applications based on BCI for undergrad thesis but couldn't do it as I was unable to acquire the required hardware. When Siwei told me he worked on BCI, I couldn't hold my expcitement and thought that Siwei's lab would be a perfect place to start the ExchangeMeet. 

We got to learn a lot about BCI ranging from fundamentals, challenges, potential applications and where does our research intersects.

    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
