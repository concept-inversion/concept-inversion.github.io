I got to know that he reserach was in brain computer interface and showed me one of his resaerch poster. During my undergrad (in 2014), I was planning to build some applications based on BCI for undergrad thesis but couldn’t do it as I was unable to acquire the required hardware. When Siwei told me he worked on BCI, I couldn’t hold my expcitement and thought that Siwei’s lab would be a perfect place to start the ExchangeMeet.</p> <p>We got to learn a lot about BCI, ranging from fundamentals, challenges, potential applications, and where our research intersects. What we found was “graph”. Our lab has done a lot of work on accelerating graph applications. For BCI, graph representation also seems to be important. Some other intersecting topic was matrix factorization.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/exchangeMeet/1_bci.JPG" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/exchangeMeet/1_bci.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="exchangemeet"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[First ExchangeMeet]]></summary></entry></feed>
