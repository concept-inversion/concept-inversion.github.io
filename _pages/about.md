I am a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at Rutgers University, supervised by Prof. [Hang Liu](https://asherliu.github.io/). I completed my undergraduate from Tribhuvan University, Nepal where my undergraduate research advisor was Prof. [Subarna Shakya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-dr-subarna-shakya-0b636b54/). During my PhD, I interned at Google, Lawerence Berkeley National Lab and Brookhaven National Lab. 


My research interests lie at the intersection of systems and ML/HPC applications, focusing on full-circle innovation--using ML/HPC to design better systems (more current focus) and building optimized systems for ML/HPC applications. Notably, I have worked on developing accurate and reusable ML-based microarchitecture simulators while also accelerating and scaling these simulation models with hardware-software co-design, demonstrating the synergy between system optimization and ML/HPC.

I enjoy hiking and playing soccer in my free time.
