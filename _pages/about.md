I am a PhD student in Computer Engineering at Rutgers University, supervised by Hang Liu. I completed my undergraduate from Tribhuvan University, Nepal where my undergraduate research advisor was Professor Subarna Shakya. You can see my publications in the publication tab or at google scholar for my most recent publications.

My research interests lie at the intersection of systems and ML, focusing on full circle innovation--using ML/HPC to design better systems (more current focus) and building optimized systems for ML/HPC applications. Notably, I have worked on developing accurate and reusable ML-based microarchitecture simulators, while also accelerating and scaling these simulation models with hardware software co-design, demonstrating the synergy between system optimization and ML.
