I am a PhD student in Computer Engineering at Rutgers University, supervised by Prof. Hang Liu. I completed my undergraduate from Tribhuvan University, Nepal where my undergraduate research advisor was Prof. Subarna Shakya. During my PhD, I interned at Google, Lawerence Berkeley National Lab and Brookhaven National Lab. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of systems and ML, focusing on full circle innovation--using ML/HPC to design better systems (more current focus) and building optimized systems for ML/HPC applications. Notably, I have worked on developing accurate and reusable ML-based microarchitecture simulators, while also accelerating and scaling these simulation models with hardware software co-design, demonstrating the synergy between system optimization and ML.
