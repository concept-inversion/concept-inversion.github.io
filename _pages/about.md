I am a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering at Rutgers University, supervised by Prof. [Hang Liu](https://asherliu.github.io/). I completed my undergraduate from Tribhuvan University, Nepal where my undergraduate research advisor was Prof. [Subarna Shakya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-dr-subarna-shakya-0b636b54/). During my PhD, I interned at Google, Lawerence Berkeley National Lab and Brookhaven National Lab. 


My research interests lie at the intersection of systems and ML/HPC applications, focusing on full-circle innovation--using ML/HPC to design better systems (more current focus) and building optimized systems for ML/HPC applications. Notably, I have worked on developing accurate and reusable ML-based microarchitecture simulators while also accelerating and scaling these simulation models with hardware-software co-design, demonstrating the synergy between system optimization and ML/HPC.

My long-term focus is on automating the design and optimization of computing stacks (programs, compilers, and microarchitecture), leveraging generative models for design generation and deep learning models for performance modeling/optimization.

[ I am actively recruiting 2-3 highly motivated and dedicated PhD students to join my research group during the Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 cycle. These positions will be fully funded (tuition waiver + competitive stipend). My lab will focus on Machine Learning(ML)-driven computing systems, bridging high-performance computing, ML, and computer architecture. </b>
