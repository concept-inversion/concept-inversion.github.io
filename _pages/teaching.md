You are in a conference you do not know much people. How would you approach someone, maybe who works in a different domain and strike up a conversation on a research topic? 

That thought is the seed motivation behind cross-lab pizza talk. 

The whole idea is to get some food, have a casual discussion, and learn something from each other as we work in close but different domains. Importantly, have fun!  

We are just keeping it to two labs to make the discussion more intimate. The topic of the discussion would be limited to see how our research intersects, and everybody learns something from each other related to their own research.  

Also, we will learn how to introduce our research to others, possibly to people working on different domains, in a safe setting. This would be very valuable for meeting people in conferences where we can meet and make connections with people in informal settings.  
 


Week 1: Had first pizza talk last week with a lab working on brain computer interface and it went really well. We got to know how our fundamental research intersects even when our work is in a much different domain. Some topics: Matrix factorization, traditional vs deep learning based pattern recognition, meaning of foundational model for BCI etc.
