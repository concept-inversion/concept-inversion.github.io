#### "ExchangeMeet: Building bridges, One slice at a time"

You are at a conference, and you do not know many people. How would you approach someone, maybe who works in a different domain and strike up a conversation on a research topic? 

As a PhD student, you mostly spend your earlier years in your own work and lab, with limited exposure/interactions with other researchers (true, at least me!).

That thought is the seed motivation behind ExchangeMeet, a meetup with students from diverse labs working in different domains, either systems, machine learning, signal processing, physics or maths. The more diverse, more better! Keeping it to just two labs make the discussion more intimate and focused.  


The whole idea behind this meet is to get some food, have a casual discussion, learn how to introduce/discuss your research, and learn something from each other's work from different domains and how they intersect. Most importantly, have fun! Also, we will learn how to introduce our research to others, possibly to people working on different domains, in a safe setting. This would be very valuable for meeting people in conferences where we can meet and make connections with people in an informal setting.  
 


Week 1: Had first pizza talk last week with a lab working on brain computer interface and it went really well. We got to know how our fundamental research intersects even when our work is in a much different domain. Some topics: Matrix factorization, traditional vs deep learning based pattern recognition, meaning of foundational model for BCI etc.
